# Counter-LDR Project

This project is designed to create a counter using a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and a microcontroller. The counter increments based on the changes in light intensity detected by the LDR. This can be useful for various applications such as counting objects passing through a light beam or monitoring light levels in an environment.

## Features

- **Light Detection**: Uses an LDR to detect changes in light intensity.
- **Microcontroller Integration**: Utilizes a microcontroller to process the LDR signals and increment the counter.
- **Real-time Counting**: Provides real-time counting based on light changes.
- **Display Output**: Option to display the count on an LCD or other display modules.

## Components

- Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP32)
- Resistors
- Display module (optional)
- Connecting wires
- Breadboard or PCB

## Setup and Installation

1. Connect the LDR to the microcontroller as per the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the provided code to the microcontroller.
3. Power the circuit and observe the counter incrementing based on light changes.
