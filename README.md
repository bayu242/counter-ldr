## Introduction

The Counter-LDR project uses a microcontroller to detect and count changes in light intensity using an LDR sensor. This can be useful for various applications such as monitoring light levels, counting objects passing through a light beam, and more.

## Features

- Detects changes in light intensity using an LDR sensor
- Counts the number of events
- Displays the count on an LCD screen

## Hardware Requirements

- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP32)
- Light-dependent resistor (LDR)
- Resistors
- LCD screen
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE or compatible software
- Microcontroller libraries (e.g., LiquidCrystal for LCD)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/counter-ldr.git
   ```
2. Open the project in the Arduino IDE.
3. Connect the hardware components as per the circuit diagram.
4. Upload the code to the microcontroller.

## Usage

1. Power on the microcontroller.
2. The LCD screen will display the count of LDR events.
3. Reset the count by pressing the reset button on the microcontroller.
