# Counter-LDR Project

This project is designed to create a counter using a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and a microcontroller. The counter increments based on the changes in light intensity detected by the LDR. This can be useful for various applications such as counting objects passing through a light beam or monitoring light levels in an environment.
